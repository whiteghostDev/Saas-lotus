## Extensibility

Lotus aims to serve as many use cases as possible! We want to make sure that you
can extend the project to fit your needs. We have a special tag in our issues
for features that already have a framework or template for you to use, allowing
you to enhance the code to fit your needs seamlessly. For example, building a
new integration with a payment processor, or hooking up a different CRM.

You can find these issues tagged with the
[extensibility label in our Github issues](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aextensibility).

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Local Development

In order to develop locally, we recommend using Docker to set up the
environment, which allows for hot reloading of both frontend and backend code.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and
   make sure it is running.
2. Clone the repo (our version, or your fork of it) and navigate to the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uselotus/lotus.git && cd lotus
```

3. Change the environment variables located in `env/.env.dev.example` to suit
   your needs. If you need help you can check out the example environment
   variables at the bottom of this page.
4. Rename `env/.env.dev.example` to `env/.env.dev`. Make sure you don't commit
   your secret environment variables anywhere!
5. Build and run the Docker Image!

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml --env-file env/.env.dev up --build
```

You should now be able to access the homepage at
[localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), and sign in using the
`ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you defined. The homepage takes a minute
or two to load, so be patient!

If you make any changes to the backend settings, you might need to restart the
Docker container.

#### üîç Before Committing

1. Run tests

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/run-tests-docker.sh  && ./scripts/run-tests-docker.sh
```

2. Check the python code style

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/run-codestyle-docker.sh  && ./scripts/run-codestyle-docker.sh
```
