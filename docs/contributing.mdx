## Extensibility

Lotus aims to serve as many use cases as possible! We want to make sure that you
can extend the project to fit your needs. We have a special tag in our issues
for features that already have a framework or template for you to use, allowing
you to enhance the code to fit your needs seamlessly. For example, building a
new integration with a payment processor, or hooking up a different CRM.

You can find these issues tagged with the
[extensibility label in our Github issues](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aextensibility).

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Local Development

To develop locally, we recommend using Docker to set up the
environment, which allows for hot reloading of both frontend and backend code.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Clone the repo and navigate to the project
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/uselotus/lotus.git && cd lotus
   ```
3. Run the self-hosting script:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/dev.sh
   ```
   If you need to give the script permission to run, run `chmod 755 ./scripts/dev.sh` first.
4. You should now be able to access the homepage at [localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), and sign in using the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you defined, or the default, which is:
   ```py
   username: change_me
   password: change_me
   ```

Optionally:

- Change the environment variables located in `env/.env.dev` to suit your needs. For more details, check out [this guide in our docs](https://docs.uselotus.io/docs/overview/self-hosting).

If you make any changes to the backend settings or the environment variables, you might need to restart the Docker container.

#### üîç Before Committing

1. Run tests

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/run-tests-docker.sh  && ./scripts/run-tests-docker.sh
```

2. Check the python code style

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/run-codestyle-docker.sh  && ./scripts/run-codestyle-docker.sh
```
