Sometimes, you might want to give a customer a plan that is only a slight
variation of an existing one. For example, for an enterprise customer, you might
want to increase the base fee of a plan, and include the extra feature of
"Dedicated Support". In that case, you can select the existing plan as a
template, then make the necessary changes to the plan, and attach it to a
specific customer, as seen below:
