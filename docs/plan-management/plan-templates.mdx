title: "Bespoke Plans"
---

Sometimes, you might want to give a customer a plan that is only a slight variation of an existing one. Or you might have an extensive negotiation process with a lead that results in a significantly different plan than the standard template.

For example, for an enterprise customer, you might want to increase the base fee of a plan, and include the extra feature of “Dedicated Support”.

Lotus has built-in functionality for this use case called Custom Plans.

You can use existing plans as a template and create custom plans based off of them. Then you can assign the custom plan to specific customers so that only they can be on that plan and the plan doesn’t show up in the getPlans() API if you have a self-serve motion.

To view all custom plans, go to the plan they were based off of and select the custom plans tab and then you can filter through every custom plan that was created.
