title: "Plan Versioning"
description: "With Lotus' plan versioning, you can easily
create new versions of your plans, and control the behavior of users who are on
older versions of your plans."

Pricing is one of the most important levers for growth, and it's important to be
able to iterate on your pricing and packaging strategy smoothly and with minimal
engineering headaches.

Our versioning system works by having all versions of a plan be either `active`
(displayed by default when you list all plans, used to sign up a customer if you
only specify a plan id and not a specific version), `grandfathered` (no longer
displayed by default, but still available to customers who are already on that
plan), and `inactive`/`archived` (no active subscriptions, the only difference
is that archived won't show up in the versions screen to reduce clutter).

Currently, we support:

- Transferring all users currently on a plan to the newest version at renewal
  time, or immediately
- Marking the currently active version as "grandfathered" before replacing it
  with a new active version, meaning that users on that version will not be
  automatically transferred to any new version until you specify otherwise
- Creating plan versions as inactive, giving you the flexibility to
  [run backtests](/experimentation/backtests) or do other necessary testing
  before making a plan version active

## Multi-Currency Versions

In addition, each version can have multiple currencies. You have to define the prices for each currency (we don't currently integrate with an exchange rate api nor do we believe that is the smartest behavior for your business).

This enables you to define multiple currency plans under the same version, so that you can serve customers globally.
