title: "Create a customer"
---

A `Create Customer` call requires

- `customer_id` which uniquely identifies your customer in your backend. This is
  the same id you'll pass into track_event calls to identify the customer, in
  addition to other calls, so make sure it's available to you.
- `email` an email for your customer

Optionally you can submit:

- `name` a name for your customer
- `payment_provider` choices are ["stripe"]
- `payment_provider_id` associated id for your customers payment provider
- `properties` any additional metadata related to your customer
