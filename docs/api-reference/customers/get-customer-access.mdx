openapi: "GET /api/customer_access/"

Returns a [customer_access](/api-reference/customer-object) response.

Checks whether a customer has access to a specific feature or enough usage in their plan to register an event. This is useful if you want to gate access to certain features in your app based on usage.

A `Check Customer Access` call requires

- customer_id the id you defined in your backend for the corresponding customer and the same id that you passed into Lotus when creating the customer

AND EITHER

- `feature_name` name of the feature you want to check access for.

OR

- `event_name` name of the event you want to check access for. In the backend we'll check whether any of the plan components associated with the event have surpassed their limit.
- `event_limit_type` the type of limit you want to check. Pass in free to check if the customer has access to free units, or total to see if the customer has access to the event_name at all.
