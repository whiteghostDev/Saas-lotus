title: Create a subscription
description: Add a plan to a customer's subscription
---

A subscription associates one of your customers with one of your billing plans. You can safely give a custoemr multiple subscriptions to different plans.

If you want to give a single customer multiple subscriptions to the same plan (for example, one for each of their environments), you can do that using `subscription_filters`. For more details on how to use them and what they do, see the [subscription filters](../../plan-management/creating-plans#plan-components) documentation.

If any of your usage components has a [prepaid charge](../../plan-management/creating-plans#plan-components) associated with it, you can specify how many untis they prepaid for as part of this call. If you don't specify a value, the component's default value will be used. If there was no default value, the susbcription creation will fail.
