A subscription associates one of your customers with one of your billing plans.

A `Create Subscription` call requires

- `customer_id` which uniquely identifies your customer in your backend. This is the same id you'll pass into track_event calls to identify the customer, in addition to other calls, so make sure it's available to you.
- `plan_id` which uniquely identifies your plan in your backend. You can find the plan id in the plan page in Lotus.
- `start_date` the date the subscription starts. This should be a string in YYYY-MM-DD format of the date in UTC time.

Optionally you can submit:

- `end_date` the date the subscription ends. This should be a string in YYYY-MM-DD format of the date in UTC time. If you don't set it (recommended), we will use the information in the billing plan to automatically calculate this.
- `is_new` a boolean indicating whether this is a new subscription or an existing subscription that you're updating/renewing. If you don't pass in this field, we will assume it's a new subscription.
- `auto-renew` a boolean indicating whether the subscription should auto-renew. If you don't pass in this field, we will assume it's true.
