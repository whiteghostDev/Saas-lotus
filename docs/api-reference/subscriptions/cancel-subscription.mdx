A `Cancel Subscription` call requires

- `subscription_id` the unique ID of the subscription you want to cancel. You
  can find the subscription uid in the subscription page in Lotus.

Additionally, you must submit:

- `turn_off_auto_renew` a boolean indicating whether the subscription
  auto-renewal should be turned off. A common cancellation mechanism is to
  continue billing for the current period, but not renew the subscription.

OR

- `replace_immediately_type` in case you want the subscription cancelled
  immediately. This can take on a value of end_current_subscription_and_bill or
  end_current_subscription_and_dont_bill. The former will end the subscription
  immediately and bill the customer for the current period. The latter will end
  the subscription immediately and not bill the customer for the current period.

```py Python
lotus.cancel_subscription(
  subscription_id='subscription_4',
  turn_off_auto_renew=True
)

lotus.cancel_subscription(
  subscription_id='subscription_4',
  replace_immediately_type='end_current_subscription_and_bill'
)
```

```ts Typescript
await lotus.cancelSubscription({
  subscriptionId: "subscription_123",
  turnOffAutoRenew: true,
});

await lotus.cancelSubscription({
  subscriptionId: "subscription_123",
  replaceImmediatelyType: "end_current_subscription_and_bill",
});
```
