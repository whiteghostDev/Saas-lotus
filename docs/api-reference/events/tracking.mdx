openapi: POST /api/track/
description: "Tracking product usage is one of the most common operations you'll make in Lotus. 

It's used to capture any event that you might want to bill on at any point."
---

You can track absolutely anything, and with the extensible and customizable properties field, you can add as much information as you want.

A `Track Event` call requires array of objects

- `event_name` should correspond to what the event is and match what you define in your metrics.
- `customer_id` the id you defined in your backend for the corresponding customer and the same id that you passed into Lotus when creating the customer

Optionally you can submit

- `properties`, which can be a dict with any information you'd like to add. In your metrics you can define properties to filer or aggregate over.
- `idempotency_id` is a unique identifier for the specific event being passed in. Passing in a unique id allows Lotus to make sure no double counting occurs. If you don't pass in an idempotency_id, we will generate one for you using UUID4.
- `time_created` is the time that the event occured, represented as a datetime in ISO 8601 in the UTC timezome. If you don't pass in a time_created, we will use the time that the event was created by the Lotus SDK.

```python Python
lotus.track_event(
  customer_id='customer123',
  event_name='api_call',
  properties={
      'region': 'US',
      'mb_used': 150
    }
  idempotency_id='c9799bf9-e5c9-4007-8d10-0663d045d23c'
)
```

```ts Typescript
await lotus.trackEvent({
  batch: [
    {
      eventName: "test", // required
      timeCreated: new Date(), // optional, if not provided current time will be taken
      customerId: "cust_58947673-64aa-4e64", // required
      properties: { test: "test", numericQuantity: 3.1415 }, //optional, pass in any additional properties you want to aggregate or measure
      idempotencyId: "c2c5eb5d-de4b-44e0", //optional if not provided Randomly generated ID will be taken
    },
