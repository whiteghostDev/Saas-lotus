openapi: GET /api/ping/

## Getting Started

You can access Lotus's API directly or through the SDKs we have built. We highly recommend using the SDKs as they provide a more user-friendly interface to the API and some of the endpoints are overloaded to provide a flexible functionality.

All api calls must be made over https to api.uselotus.io/api/

### How to use your API key

Your API key obtained in the Lotus Frontend Settings tab, is only visible once your create it and, therefore, must be stored securely.

If you create a new API key, your **old API key will be revoked** and it will not authenticate endpoints.

The API key must be passed into the _X-API-KEY_ header in your requests.

To confirm that your API key is working, you can make a request to the _/api/ping_ endpoint. This will return the id of the organization the API key belongs to.
