Lotus exposes endpoints to fully integrate into your stack. All webhooks maintain the following structure.

Here is a list of current webhooks.

### invoice.created

This webhook is generated when a subscription ends and an invoice is generated.

### invoice.payment_successful

This webhook is generated when a payment through a payment provider integration is successful (i.e. a payment through Stripe).

### invoice.payment_failed

This webhook is generated when a payment through a payment provider integration failed (i.e. a payment through Stripe).
