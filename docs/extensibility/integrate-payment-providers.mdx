title: "Integrating New Payment Providers"
---

Currently, Lotus only supports Stripe as a payment provider. However, we have
designed our code in such a way that you can easily integrate other payment
providers. Whether you want to create a proprietary integration in your
self-hosted solution, or you want to create a new integration for the community
to use, we've got you covered.

To learn how to contribute to the project, please check out our
[contributing guide](/contributing).

## Backend

The places where payment providers are used in the Lotus workflow are:

- Connecting an organization to a payment provider. We must provide the
  functionality to allow the front end to communicate to a user whether they've
  been connected to a payment provider, and to update the organization model
  with the appropriate information.
- Interfacing with the payment provider to generate an "external" invoice. Even
  though we keep our own version of an invoice, we need to let the payment
  provider know how to charge the customer.
- Importing existing customer information from the payment provider into Lotus.

### Creating your own payment provider

To create your own integration, you have to do the following:

1. Create a concrete class that implements the `PaymentProvider` interface. This
   interface is defined in
   [metering_billing/payment_providers.py](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/027f9c456093b53b8d331f8c0cf6df2e6a96a58c/backend/metering%5Fbilling/payment%5Fproviders.py#L1)).
   You can see the implementation of the Stripe version (`StripeConnector`
   class) in the file. The type hints should be relatively self-explanatory, but
   if you have any doubts, don't be afraid to reach out in the
   [Lotus Community Slack](https://lotus-community.slack.com).
2. Add your payment provider to the
   [Payment Providers enum](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/027f9c456093b53b8d331f8c0cf6df2e6a96a58c/backend/metering%5Fbilling/utils.py#L35).
   This will allow it to be a field in the models and be used throughout Lotus.
3. To let the Lotus app access the functionality provided by your
   implementation, go to the `metering_billing/invoice.py` file, and add an
   instance of your connector to the `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_MAP` dictionary. From
   here, the boilerplate will take care of using the methods you defined to
   execute Lotus' billing logic. To see how we did it with Stripe,
   [check out this line](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/027f9c456093b53b8d331f8c0cf6df2e6a96a58c/backend/metering%5Fbilling/payment%5Fproviders.py#L249).

## Frontend

You might want to integrate your payment provider in the frontend to allow for
granular control over methods in the UI, including the ability to check the
connection status or sync customers.

This frontend display is much more open-ended than the backend integration but
we still have a few steps that can get you started:

1. In the `frontend/src/types/payment-processor-type.ts` file, create a new
   interface for the data sent in a request to Lotus' backend and add it as an
   option for the `data` parameter in the
   `PaymentProcessorConnectionRequestType` interface. You can see that for the
   Stripe integration, the only data we needed was the authorization code
   provided by the Oauth integration.
2. In the `frontend/src/integrations/PaymentProcessorIntegrations.tsx` file,
   create a new functional component that describes what should happen once we
   get redirected from the authorization page for your payment processor. We
   have an example of how we did it for Stripe in the file.
3. In the `frontend/src/config/Routes.tsx` file, add a new route for your
   payment processor. You can see how we did it for Stripe in the file.
