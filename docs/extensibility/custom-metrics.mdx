title: "Extending Billable Metrics"
---

Billable metrics are the way to transform raw events into usable aggregations
that you can later use for permission gating, billing, and analytics. Lotus
currently supports two types of billable metrics: `Aggregation` metrics and
`Stateful` metrics.

Aggregation metrics can be thought of as computing SQL-like aggregations over
the values of properties of the events; for example, the count of events with
the name `api_call`, or the sum of the property `character_count` of the events
of type `message`.

Stateful metrics, on the other hand, assume that events are documenting a change
to some underlying state. For example, the property `num_users` in events of
type `log_users` might inform Lotus of how many users a customer currently has
on the product. There's always some number of users; the events are simply there
to inform Lotus of changes. If you're using seats as a gating mechanism or
billing metric, you'll want to use stateful metrics.

We recognize that there are probably a lot more ways that you might want to
aggregate the events you're sending to Lotus. Because of that, we've made it as
easy as possible to add your own custom types of metrics, for when the defaults
aren't enough! You can keep your metric proprietary, or fork the repo, submit a
PR, and make it available to the community. The rest of this page will walk you
through the process of creating your own custom metric.

## Backend

The places where payment providers are used in the Lotus workflow are:

- Calculating usage. This functionality is mainly used for displaying metric
  usage graphs, and for gating access to a part of the product depending on use.
- Calculating _billable_ usage. Though this can often be the same thing as
  usage, it all depends on what granularity you're calculating the usage in. For
  example, if your billable metric is the `max` of `property`, then you might
  reasonably expect the daily usage graph to include the maximum per day.
  However, if you wanted to see a daily revenue graph, then you only really
  generated revenue on the day that the event with the `max` over `property` in
  the whole billing period occurred.

### Creating your own Billable Metric types

To create your own metric, you have to do the following:

1. Add your metric type to the
   [Metric Types choice set](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/14eb3cd1c0c639b539ea3b7f654b8c4ad5a75b65/backend/metering%5Fbilling/utils/enums/enums.py#L37).
   If you want to create a new aggregation type, please update it in
   the[Metric Aggregation choice set](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/14eb3cd1c0c639b539ea3b7f654b8c4ad5a75b65/backend/metering%5Fbilling/utils/enums/enums.py#L17).
   This will allow your metric type to be used in the model.
2. Create a concrete class that implements the `BillableMetricHandler`
   interface. This interface is defined in
   `lotus/backend/metering_billing/billable_metrics.py`. You can see the
   implementation of the `AggregationHandler` and `StatefulHandler`,
   representing the implementation for `Aggregation` and `Stateful` metrics,
   respectively. The type hints should be relatively self-explanatory, but if
   you have any doubts, don't be afraid to reach out in the
   [Lotus Community Slack](https://lotus-community.slack.com).
   - One key point is that to make it fully extensible, we are storing all the
     extra required fields in the `properties` JSONField of the BillableMetric
     model. This means that you'll have to parse the `properties` field to get
     the extra fields you need, and also be responsible for validating the
     `properties` field when a new object is being created. The comments will
     guide you through it.
3. Still in `lotus/backend/metering_billing/billable_metrics.py`, add a mapping
   to the
   [METRIC_HANDLER_MAP](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/d1726c0635a1cc0a9b14d768a390b684e18cd669/metering%5Fbilling/billable%5Fmetrics.py#L432)
   with the key equal to the new entry you made in the
   [Metric Types choice set](https://github.com/uselotus/lotus/blob/14eb3cd1c0c639b539ea3b7f654b8c4ad5a75b65/backend/metering%5Fbilling/utils/enums/enums.py#L37),
   and the value equal to the concrete class you just created. This mapping will
   get propagated throughout Lotus and will be used to extract your handler and
   use the methods you implemented in the previous step to make Lotus run.

## Frontend

1. All you have to change is the
   `lotus/frontend/src/components/Metrics/MetricTable.tsx` file, which
   represents the modal pop-up where users define their metrics. You can guide
   yourself using the existing examples used for `Aggregation` and `Stateful`
   metrics, but if you are primarily a backend developer and need help creating
   more complex logic with the new fields you defined for the frontend, please
   reach out to us in the
   [Lotus Community Slack](https://lotus-community.slack.com).

That's it! After doing this and either pushing to your local version or merging
a PR, you should be able to use your new metric type as if it were one of the
default ones. If you don't want to create a BillableMetric yourself, then please
refer to our roadmap and vote on the features you'd like to see.
