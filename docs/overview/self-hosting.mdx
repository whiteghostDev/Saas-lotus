### ðŸ’» Local Hobby Instance

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and
   make sure it is running.
2. Clone the repo and navigate to the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uselotus/lotus.git && cd lotus
```

3. Change the environment variables located in `env/.env.prod.example` to suit
   your needs. If you need help you can check out the example environment
   variables at the bottom of this page.
4. Rename `env/.env.prod.example` to `env/.env.prod`. Make sure you don't commit
   your secret environment variables anywhere!
5. Build and run the Docker Image!

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml --env-file env/.env.prod up --build
```

You should now be able to access the homepage at
[localhost/](http://localhost/), and sign in using the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` you defined.

We are currently working on easy deployment options for AWS, GCP, and Azure. If
you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.
