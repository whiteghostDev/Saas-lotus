title: "Managing Feature Access"
---

While pricing is the obvious variable to tweak, packaging is potentially even
more important to iterate on and match the evolving customer segments your SaaS
serves. Lotus was built to enable the management of packaging as well as pricing
and can plug into your product's code to accomplish this.

Since Lotus acts as a source of truth for your pricing plans, you can pull
information about what features a customer currently has access to. By storing
the feature and usage entitlements of each customer in Lotus, you are now free
to change packaging in one place without completely overhauling custom code in
your application.

You can implement this core capability programmatically by following this
([guide](/api/customers/get-customer-access)).

You can check if a customer has access to both:

- Components: Checking if a customer has access to free units as part of their
  current plan or checking the max limit on their units.
- Features: Checking if a customer has access to a boolean feature like a
  certain integration or page in the application.

This feature access is meant to augment existing authorization infrastructure so
that entitlements can change flexibly as you change your plans in Lotus.
