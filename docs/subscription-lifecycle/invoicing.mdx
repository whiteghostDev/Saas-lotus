title: "Invoicing"
description: "After a subscription ends, an invoice is generated."

Lotus aggregates all of the usage during the subscription and calculates the
line items and final total that the customer owes your business.

Lotus provides a webhook that will send an invoice-generated event to a URL you
specify so that your team can stay up to date on the invoices that have been
issued.

After generating an invoice, Lotus integrates with your payment gateway or
provider to collect the cash for your invoice.

For every customer, you can choose how each should be invoiced based on the
current integrations. You may also choose to generate the invoice yourself and
collect payment without a 3rd-party integration.

We primarily integrate with Stripe to send payment_intents or invoices through
Stripe Invoice. You can use Stripe to handle the final complexities such as
sales tax and dunning. We don't currently handle these.

Currently, Lotus is close to integrating with Bill.com and Paddle to expand the
invoicing + collection options.
