title: "Invoicing"
---

Lotus aggregates all of the usage during the subscription and calculates the
line items and the final total that the customer owes your business.

Lotus provides a webhook that will send an invoice-generated event to a URL you
specify so that your team can stay up to date on the invoices that have been
issued.

Lotus also generates a PDF that can be downloaded on the customer page or via this [api](../api-reference/invoices/get-invoice-pdf)

After generating an invoice, Lotus integrates with your payment gateway or
provider to collect the cash for your invoice.

For every customer, you can choose how each should be invoiced based on the
current integrations. You may also choose to generate the invoice yourself and
collect payment without a 3rd-party integration using the webhook called invoice.created.

We have native integrations with Stripe and Paypal(braintree) to send payment_intents or invoices through
Stripe Invoice. We don't currently handle dunning and collections of invoice payments.

### Currencies

Every invoice is defined in a certain currency. There are two ways of setting this currency.

1. You can set the default currency for your entire organization in the settings page.

2. You can set a specific customer's currency when you create the customer [programatically](../api-reference/customers/create-customer) or through the dashboard.

### Taxes

There are three options for configuring taxes in Lotus.

1. Use Lotus to set a tax rate at the organization level that applies to all invoices. Set this on the settings page.

2. You can set a specific tax rate per customer via the create customer api or in the frontend by clicking on a customer and editing their tax rate. If it is set, the customer tax rate will take priority over the organization tax rate.

3. If you are on the cloud or license version, you can use TaxJar to automatically calculate sales taxes for all of your charges and line items. This can be especially helpful if you sell many different SKUs in different countries.

If you want to use all 3 of these options, you can configure the order of operations/failsafe order in the settings page here by setting tax provider 1 and tax provider 2 as a backup.
