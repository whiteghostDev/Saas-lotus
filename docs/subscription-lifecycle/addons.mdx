Lotus' Add-ons feature is designed to provide greater flexibility and control when offering additional products and services to your customers. With it, you'll be able to create custom add-ons with varying pricing models, attach them to specific plans, and easily manage their invoicing and recurring status.

## Customizing Add-ons

The Add-ons feature gives you the ability to customize add-ons to suit your specific business needs. You can choose between a flat fee or usage-based pricing model, set the timing of invoicing in relation to the plan, and even attach a specific quantity of the add-on to the plan.

## Enhancing Customer Value

The Add-ons feature allows you to provide added value to your customers by offering additional features and benefits to their existing subscriptions. This can be used to upsell and cross-sell services, as well as create new revenue streams.

## Note

Addons are currently in active beta. We currently support creating addons and viewing them in the dashboard. However, attaching them through the UI is not yet supported. If you would like to use this feature, please contact us at founders@uselotus.io
