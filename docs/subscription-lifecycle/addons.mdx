## Customizing Add-ons

The Add-ons feature gives you the ability to customize add-ons to suit your specific business needs. You can choose between a flat fee or usage-based pricing model, set the timing of invoicing in relation to the plan, and even attach a specific quantity of the add-on to the plan.

## Enhancing Customer Value

The Add-ons feature allows you to provide added value to your customers by offering additional features and benefits to their existing subscriptions. This can be used to upsell and cross-sell services, as well as create new revenue streams.

## Note

Please note that the Add-ons feature is currently in development and will be released soon.
