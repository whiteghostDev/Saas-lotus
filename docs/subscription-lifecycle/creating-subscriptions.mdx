title: "Create Subscriptions"
description: "Subscriptions assign a customer to a plan for a specific period of time. That
period of time is usually specified by the plan's duration or interval (monthly,
quarterly, and yearly) and the date on which you start the subscription."
---

It is important to note that a customer can only have one subscription at a
time.

Subscriptions represent periods over which a customer will be invoiced for every
component and flat fee that is part of the associated plan.

Therefore when altering subscriptions, there are specific choices you can make
in Lotus about how and when to charge the customer.

Canceling a subscription will allow the option of either:

- issuing an invoice for that subscription period immediately,
- issuing an invoice for the subscription when the subscription was scheduled to
  renew/expire,
- or deciding to not invoice the customer for the subscription.

Another necessary behavior is the ability to switch the plan a customer is on,
usually for upgrades and downgrades. There are similar options for these
scenarios:

- End the current subscription immediately, bill for it, and then start the new
  subscription with the new plan now
- End the current subscription immediately, don't bill for it, and start the new
  one now
- Switch the plan while keeping the same subscription billing cycle

Upgrades and downgrades are handled internally for usage-based metrics based on
the proration setting for the metric. Internally we have it set = day, so for a
seats-based metric that is upgraded halfway through the month, the first half
will be calculated based on the price of the seats for the month \* (# of days/#
of days in the month). We will be adding more proration toggles and optionality
soon.
